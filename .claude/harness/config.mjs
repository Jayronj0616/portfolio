// Configuration for every gate in this harness.
//
// The harness this was extracted from hardcoded one project's commands and paths — `npm run verify`,
// `tsc --noEmit`, `src/views/apps/admin/**`. That is the single thing that made it unportable, and it
// is the only thing this file exists to fix. Everything a gate needs to know about YOUR project is
// declared once, here, and read by every script.
//
// ── THE CONFIG IS TRACKED, DELIBERATELY ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `harness.config.json` belongs at the repository root, in version control, NOT under a gitignored
// `.claude/`. It defines what "verified" means for this project — which makes it the one input that
// decides whether a gate can be satisfied at all. A definition of passing that can be widened without
// showing up in a diff is not a gate, it is a suggestion. The loader still accepts
// `.claude/harness.config.json` for projects that track that directory, but the root is the default
// and `harness-init` writes it there.
//
// ── FAILING OPEN IS THE RULE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A missing, malformed, or half-written config must never trap a session. `load()` returns a usable
// object with `errors` populated instead of throwing, and each gate decides what to do about it. The
// selftest is where a broken config becomes loud; a hook is not.
