// ── WHY A BLOCK AND NOT A MESSAGE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The obvious implementation emits a note and hopes it is read. In the system this was extracted from,
// the note-emitting version of this idea fired in ZERO sessions across the entire life of the project —
// partly a bug, partly that a `systemMessage` is easy to skip past.
//
// A block is read, because the turn does not end until it is answered. That is a real cost, so it
// happens AT MOST ONCE PER SESSION and only when there is something specific to point at.
//
// ── IT NEVER WRITES A LESSON ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Nothing in the capture path does. Recording is a deliberate act with a four-test bar behind it, and
// automating it is precisely how a curated store becomes a log. This asks the question and gets out of
// the way.
