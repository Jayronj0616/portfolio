// PreToolUse guard on Bash: blocks destructive commands that reach outside this repository, and the
// handful of in-repo commands that destroy work irrecoverably.
//
// Written after an agent running unattended deleted files outside its project. The rule is simple and
// unconditional:
//
//   A command may delete, overwrite or move things INSIDE this repo (and the OS temp dir). Anything
//   reaching outside is denied — no exceptions, no heuristics about intent.
//
// It also denies commands that destroy work without ever calling `rm`, which a naive "block rm" guard
// misses entirely:
//
//   git clean -fdx      removes untracked AND ignored files
//   git reset --hard    discards uncommitted changes
//   git checkout -- .   same
//   git restore .       same
//   git stash && <check> && git stash pop    destroys work this agent did not create
//
// ── SCOPED TO THE BINARY, PER SEGMENT — NEVER THE RAW STRING ───────────────────
//
// This is the design, not a detail. Match `git clean` against the whole command and
// `grep -rn "git clean" docs/` is blocked, as is any script that merely MENTIONS a dangerous command.
// A guard that cries wolf is a guard somebody switches off, and a switched-off guard protects nothing.
//
// So the command is split into segments and each pattern is checked only against a segment whose
// invoked binary matches.
//
// Deliberately NOT exhaustive against a determined adversary — a shell is too flexible for that. It is
// built to stop a confused agent, which is the actual threat.
//
// Try it without running anything:
//   echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"rm -rf ~/Documents"}}' | node .claude/harness/guard-destructive.mjs
